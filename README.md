# Simple Weather App

## Introduction
![alt tag](http://res.cloudinary.com/abacus/image/upload/v1470829565/weatherapp-photo_ej5ktj.png)
This app (web page) displays the current weather of the page visitor's nearby city.

It is mainly for my coding practice to use api with ajax.

This is one of the coding challenges at Free code camp (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather).

## Requirements
- You will need to sign up and get your own api key from the below website first.
https://www.wunderground.com/api
- After you get your own api key, you will need to use it to replace 'your-api-key-here' in the below code in the weather.js file (line 4 and line 35):
```
$.get( "http://api.wunderground.com/api/your-api-key-here/conditions/q/autoip.json",
```
